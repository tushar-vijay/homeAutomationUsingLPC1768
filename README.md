The Home Automation System using LPC1768 represents a pioneering endeavor aimed
at reshaping our relationship with domestic environments. Through this project, we
endeavor to introduce a paradigm shift in how individuals engage with their living
spaces. It focuses on implementing a robust home automation system
using the LPC1768 microcontroller, integrating features such as lighting control, fan
control, a password-based smart lock, and a real-time status display.
